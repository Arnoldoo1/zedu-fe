## 1. Executive Summary

**Zedu** is a cross-platform collaboration and learning workspace purpose-built for bootcamps, schools, universities, and cohort-based learning communities. The product consolidates messaging, structured channels, direct messages, voice/video meetings (Buzz), file management, search, notifications, and organization administration into a single environment — eliminating the fragmentation caused by using separate chat apps, conferencing tools, file-sharing services, and learning management utilities.

Zedu is positioned as an **AI-powered education platform** that helps educators organize cohorts, run live classes, manage communication, and scale modern learning — all within one subscription. The platform is available on **Web**, **iOS**, **Android**, and **Desktop**, with real-time synchronization across devices.

**Core value proposition:** Fewer tools, smarter learning. Replace scattered apps with one structured platform for communication, collaboration, and education workflows.

**Claimed impact metrics (marketing):**

- 10,000+ learners supported
- 98% educator satisfaction
- 3× faster cohort coordination
- 40% less admin workload

## 2. Product Vision & Goals

### Vision

To be the unified workspace where educators, administrators, and learners communicate, collaborate, and learn — without context switching between disconnected tools.

### Strategic Goals

| Goal                          | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unified communication**     | Provide channels, DMs, threads, and meetings in one interface      |
| **Education-first structure** | Organize conversations by cohort, subject, class, or project       |
| **Real-time collaboration**   | Enable instant messaging, live voice/video, and presence awareness |
| **Centralized resources**     | Offer a single hub for files, media, and shared learning materials |
| **Institutional scalability** | Support multi-org membership, role-based access, and billing tiers |
| **Cross-platform continuity** | Deliver consistent experience across web and native clients        |

### Product Principles

1. **Structure over noise** — Channels and threads keep discussions focused and searchable.
2. **Instant over scheduled** — Buzz enables on-demand voice/video without calendar friction.
3. **Onboarding simplicity** — New organizations and invited members reach productive use quickly.
4. **Role-aware governance** — Permissions scale from guest viewers to organization owners.
5. **Real-time by default** — Messages, notifications, and presence update live via WebSocket infrastructure.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

Modern learning teams — bootcamps, schools, training programs — depend on multiple disconnected tools:

- Chat applications for day-to-day communication
- Video conferencing for live classes
- File-sharing services for learning materials
- Email or LMS announcements for updates
- Separate search across siloed systems

This fragmentation causes:

- **Lost context** when conversations, files, and meetings live in different places
- **Administrative overhead** managing users and permissions across tools
- **Poor discoverability** of past discussions and shared resources
- **Delayed collaboration** when scheduling is required for simple voice discussions
- **Inconsistent learner experience** across web and mobile

Zedu addresses these problems by providing a single, structured environment where all collaboration primitives coexist.

## Appendix C: The Office — 3D Tower References

The 3D building ("The Office", `src/app/office`) is part of the product surface. The tower view is judged against these references:

### Tower requirements

These rules are the source of truth for the office work; check every visual change against them.

1. **It is a cutaway tower, not a wall of glass.** Storeys are open at the front, with slabs, a lift core, floor tags, a plinth and a roof. Every private office carries its occupant's avatar; a lit office also shows a desk silhouette, an unlit one still reads as somebody's office.
2. **The demo is the full building.** At least ten storeys, and every member floor is filled to the live capacity (40 private offices). The three walkable demo offices stay in the directory among the filler offices.
3. **Every storey sizes its own grid from its contents.** There is no fixed 8x5 slot table. Rooms expand to use the full width and height of the facade.
4. **Private offices fill the floor.** Up to 40 per member floor, twenty per row across two rows; a floor with fewer people stretches those offices across the whole facade instead of leaving empty wall.
5. **The general floor resizes for channels.** Channels wrap into as many rows as they need and each row stretches to the full width, so the top floor keeps accommodating every channel the organisation has.
6. **The lift is real.** A car rides the core to the storey in focus and idles between storeys otherwise. Selecting a storey tags it and frames it.
7. **Directory-only storeys stay honest.** Where a storey has offices in the directory but no walkable floor plan (the demo's filler floors), selecting a person frames their storey in the tower instead of diving into an empty plan.
8. **Short tags, not sentences.** Storeys carry L / F1..Fn tags; names and occupancy live in the hover card and the search.
9. **The tower is the front door.** Both the demo and the live office open on the tower, never on a floor plan. Entering the building means choosing a storey from the street.
10. **The facade faces the viewer.** The tower is framed as a straight-on elevation, not a three-quarter or side view, whatever direction the player was last looking in.
11. **Daylight outside, interior light inside.** The tower view is seen from the street: a daylight sky, a site under the plinth and a light fog. The floor view keeps the dark interior ambience the rooms are lit for.
12. **One floor picker.** Storeys are chosen from a single dropdown; there is no rail of floor buttons across the bottom of the tower.
13. **Reading a room is not entering it.** The first click on an office frames that one office and opens its DM or channel chat over the tower without moving the player or joining the room. The second click on the same office transports in, and the room's recent messages are spoken as bubbles the moment the player lands.
14. **An office shows the same person as the floor does.** The avatar in a cell is that person's own identity — the same tint their in-world rig is built from — not the room's accent colour.
15. **Leaving the office means going back to the app.** The tower's leave control returns to the 2D conversation: the organisation's chat in the live office, the site home in the demo. The tower carries no "back to the floor" control; Esc still does that.
16. **The entry copy steps back for the building.** After 30 seconds without input the entry headline, description and chips fade out and the scrim thins with them so the rotating tower/floor backdrop is visible; any movement brings the copy straight back.
17. **A private office is furnished, not a cubicle.** Every personal office starts with the same arrangement: the desk stands out in the room on its own rug with the chair behind it, and the back wall holds an open bookshelf, a reading lamp, a plant and a framed print. The tower cell shows the same desk, plant and bookshelf. Everything uses the building's one palette (`engine/palette.ts`), and any chair, sofa, armchair or bean bag can be sat on.
